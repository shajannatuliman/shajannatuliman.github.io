                                <h2>ðŸ“– What I Have Gained ðŸ“–</h2>
                                <p>The thing that I have learned from this industrial talk is that system development is its primary focus. As a computer science student, I think believe that learning the well-known concept of Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is very important as this can enhance the system performance if we follow all of the 5 steps that is being introduced which is planning, analysis, design, implementation and maintenance.</p><br />
                                <h2>ðŸ§  Improvements ðŸ§ </h2>
								<p>The enhancement that can be made is that we should actually explore deeper into the system development rather than just introducing it to us in a basic manner so that the students will be more interested in knowing the technology and tool use for the system development that is being used in the ICT field nowadays.</p><br />
								<h2>Others</h2>
								<p>I believe that in order for students to learn about all of the options available to them for pursuing careers in the future and to use it as a future reference, we should set up booths in our faculty. In order to learn more about the degrees we are currently pursuing, we should also make an arrangement for an industrial visit.</p><br />
